# CURE RocketPy Simulation

This repo contains the RocketPy simulations and configurations for our club.

## Setup

Some of our simulations are organized as Jupyter Notebooks, which allow us to run smaller sections of code easily. This makes it more efficient when tweaking a simulation and viewing plots of the results.

Follow these step-by-step instructions to get set up and run the `.ipynb` files with ease.

### **Option 1: Using Anaconda (Recommended for Beginners)**

Anaconda is a free distribution of Python that comes with Jupyter Notebook and many scientific libraries pre-installed.

#### **Step 1: Download and Install Anaconda**

1. **Download Anaconda:**
   - Visit the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) page.
   - Download the latest version of Anaconda for Python 3.x for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install Anaconda:**
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
     - **Windows Users:** When prompted, you can leave "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" unchecked to avoid conflicts.

#### **Step 2: Open Anaconda Navigator**

- Launch **Anaconda Navigator**:
  - **Windows:** Search for "Anaconda Navigator" in the Start Menu.
  - **macOS/Linux:** Open it from the Applications folder or via Terminal using `anaconda-navigator`.

#### **Step 3: Install RocketPy**

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   - In Anaconda Navigator, click on the **Environments** tab on the left.
   - Select the **base (root)** environment.
   - Click the **play button (â–¶)** next to it and choose **"Open Terminal"**.

2. **Install RocketPy:**
   - In the terminal window that opens, type the following command and press Enter:
     ```bash
     pip install rocketpy
     ```

#### **Step 4: Launch Jupyter Notebook**

- In Anaconda Navigator, go back to the **Home** tab.
- Find **Jupyter Notebook** and click **Launch**.

#### **Step 5: Open the Simulation Notebooks**

- In the Jupyter Notebook interface (opened in your web browser), navigate to the folder where you have the repository cloned or downloaded.
- Click on the notebook (`.ipynb`) file you wish to run.

#### **Step 6: Run the Notebook**

- With the notebook open, you can run each cell by:
  - Clicking on a cell and pressing **Shift + Enter**.
  - Or clicking the **Run** button in the toolbar.
- Make sure to run the cells in order for the simulation to function correctly.

### **Option 2: Using Python and Pip**

If you prefer a lighter setup without Anaconda, you can install Python and the required packages manually.

#### **Step 1: Install Python 3**

1. **Download Python:**
   - Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Download the latest Python 3 installer for your operating system.

2. **Install Python:**
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts.
     - **Windows Users:** Ensure you check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

#### **Step 2: Install Jupyter Notebook and RocketPy**

1. **Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux):**

2. **Upgrade pip (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

3. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

4. **Install RocketPy:**
   ```bash
   pip install rocketpy
   ```

#### **Step 3: Clone or Download the Repository**

- **Clone using Git:**
  - If you don't already have **Git** installed you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  - If you are not already in our **CURocketEngineering** GitHub organization, send a message on Slack to the Software Development Lead with your GitHub username. 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CURocketEngineering/RocketPy-Simulations.git
  ```
- **Or download the ZIP:**
  - Click on the **"Code"** button on the repository's GitHub page and select **"Download ZIP"**.
  - Extract the ZIP file to a known location.

#### **Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory**

- In your Command Prompt or Terminal, navigate to the directory where the repository is located:
  ```bash
  cd path/to/your-repo
  ```

#### **Step 5: Launch Jupyter Notebook**

- Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.

#### **Step 6: Open and Run the Notebook**

- Navigate to the `.ipynb` file within the Jupyter interface.
- Click on the notebook to open it.
- Run the cells in order using **Shift + Enter** or the **Run** button.

### **Additional Notes**

- **Using Virtual Environments (Optional):**
  - It's good practice to use virtual environments to manage dependencies.
  - Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```
  - Activate the virtual environment:
    - **Windows:**
      ```bash
      env\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **macOS/Linux:**
      ```bash
      source env/bin/activate
      ```
  - Install Jupyter Notebook and RocketPy within this environment.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If you encounter issues, ensure all installations completed without errors.
  - Verify your Python and pip versions:
    ```bash
    python --version
    pip --version
    ```
  - If Jupyter Notebook doesn't launch, check that it's installed in the correct Python environment.
